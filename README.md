# How to use?

I can't believe I have to explain this, 
- you go to releases and download the latest release, as of now, this is the latest [release](https://github.com/XatzClient/Sigma-Deleter/releases/download/v1.10/Sigma-Deleter_v1.3.jar)
- you then double click the jar and then press delete sigma, (Make sure you have java installed though, https://mega.nz/folder/EolCyShY#D0QUZdcafG1mUXbqWywFsg/file/Z4sgCCwA use this link for a swift install of java.) 

----- Additional Help -----

- If you got java, but jar wont open the GUI for sigma deleter, use this https://www.heise.de/software/download/jarfix/41657 If you are on linux and you have issues, then congrats! You finally have the best type of OS (only use Arch and Arch based distro's tho, they are just the best).
